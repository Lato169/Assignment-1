      <p style="font-size: 2rem">What are Life Goals? Life goals are what we want to achieve, and they're much more meaningful than just 'what we need to accomplish to survive'. Unlike daily routines or short-term objectives, they drive our behaviors over the long run. Below are a couple goals of mine;</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 2rem">Challenge myself every day.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 2rem">Become more mindful.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 2rem">Time Management.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 2rem">Learn something new. </li>
        <li style="font-size: 2rem">Start (and finish) a big creative project.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 2rem">Gain financial freedom.</li>
